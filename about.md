# About Me

Hey, I’m Will. I'm a data analyst and
a recent graduate of Reed College, where I studied
mathematics and statistics, as well as a smattering of Chinese, history,
linguistics, and physics. Statistical modeling, data visualization, and
programming are my passions.

But I’m not all about my work. I’m most at peace when in the middle of preparing
a tasty meal or exploring the beautiful trails and mountains of the Pacific
Northwest.
